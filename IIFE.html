    <!--Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE) are JavaScript functions that are executed immediately after they are defined. 
    They are typically used to create a local scope for variables to prevent them from polluting the global scope.  -->
    <!--Syntax:

(function (){ 
// Function Logic Here. 
})();  -->


<!-- Use Cases Of IIFE
Avoid polluting the global namespace.
To create closures in JavaScript.
IIFE is used to create private and  public variables and methods.
It is used to execute the async and await function.
It is used to work with require function. -->

<script>
    async function sleep() {
        return new Promise((resolve,reject)=>{
               setTimeout(()=>{
                resolve(45)

               },1000);
        })
        
    }
    // let a=await sleep();
    // this will give an error since await can only be used inside an async

    // Best way to do this is use IIFE which will quickly invoke itself
    (async function main(){
            let a=await sleep()
            console.log(a)
    })()


    // Here, you're defining and immediately running the function without and actual call
    // Because you can't use await outside an async function, and:

// You don't want to define a function and call it separately.

// You just want to run async code as soon as your script loads.
</script>
