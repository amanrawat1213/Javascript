    const PI = 3.141592653589793;
// PI = 3.14;      // This will give an error
// PI = PI + 10;   // This will also give an error
// Constant Objects and Arrays
// You can create a constant array:
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];

// You can change an element:
cars[0] = "Toyota";

// You can add an element:
cars.push("Audi");
console.log(cars);
</script>
<!-- The keyword const is a little misleading.

It does not define a constant value. It defines a constant reference to a value.

Because of this you can NOT:

Reassign a constant value
Reassign a constant array
Reassign a constant object
But you CAN:

Change the elements of constant array
Change the properties of constant object -->
